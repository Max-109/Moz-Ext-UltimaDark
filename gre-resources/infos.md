The `gre-resources` folder contains relevant default Firefox styles, which can be found at `resource://gre-resources/`. I have stored them here to enable automatic filtering on relevant properties and to allow for easy editing to match the UltimaDark colors. This step is crucial to ensure that many default colors, such as inputs, placeholders, textareas, selects, and more, are updated accordingly. If this step is not done, these default colors will remain unchanged.
